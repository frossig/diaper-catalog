Diaper Catalog

Welcome to the Diaper Catalog project!

    Stock Availability: Users can quickly identify whether a product is in stock or out of stock through visual indicators.

    Smooth Scrolling: The smooth scrolling feature enhances the user experience, allowing seamless navigation through the catalog.
